We are trying to use Tensorlog for Community Detection in complex Networks (like Twitter).
First few goals are listed below:
a) Add three social-networks datasets (atleast one should be Twtiiter)
b) Try exisitng supervised and semi-supervised algorithms to get a baseline
c) Format the networks data in the format TensorLog data format
d) Use TensorLog to get community detection accuracy
e) Update TenrLog if needed to make it a better for community detection in complex networks



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the GitHub repository for TensorLog. Package documentation can be found in the [tensorlog](tensorlog) directory. Tutorials and research documentation is on the [wiki](https://github.com/TeamCohen/TensorLog/wiki).

Additional (larger) datasets are available publicly:

     $ git clone http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/git/tensorlog-datasets.git

Branch conventions:

working -- stable, all/most sample datasets & tests should run

master -- in limbo; currently contains 1.3.4

0.0.0 -- wc's versioning of tensorflow cross-compiler mechanics

0.0.0-dev -- wc's bleeding-edge branch
