# TensorLog
Orginal Source TeamCohen/TensorLog


We are trying to use Tensorlog for Community Detection in complex Networks (like Twitter). The first few goals are listed below:

a) Add three social-networks datasets (atleast one should be Twtiiter)
    
    -- Added Twitter Stance dataset (https://github.com/kennyjoseph/constance) 
    
    -- Added Twitter EchoChamber dataset from Pew research (https://nodexlgraphgallery.org/Pages/InteractiveGraph.aspx?graphID=2272)

b) Try exisitng supervised and semi-supervised algorithms to get a baseline

c) Format the networks data in the format TensorLog data format

d) Use TensorLog to get community detection accuracy

e) Update TenrLog if needed to make it a better for community detection in complex networks
